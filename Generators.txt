Generator functions allow you to declare a function that behaves like an iterator.

They allow programmers to make an iterator in a fast, easy, and clean way.
Generators are used to create iterators, but with a different approach.
Generators are simple functions which return an iterable set of items, one at a time, in a special way.

Generator-Function : A generator-function is defined like a normal function, but whenever it needs to generate a value,
it does so with the yield keyword rather than return. If the body of a def contains yield,
the function automatically becomes a generator function.

Generator-Object : Generator functions return a generator object.
Generator objects are used either by calling the next method on the generator object or using the generator object
in a “for in” loop .
