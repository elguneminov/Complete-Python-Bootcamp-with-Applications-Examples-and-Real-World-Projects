**OBJECT**
object is one of instances of the class. which can perform the functionalities which are defined in the class.

**__init__ method**
"__init__" is a reserved method in python classes. It is called as a constructor in object oriented terminology.
This method is called when an object is created
from a class and it allows the class to initialize the attributes of the class.
It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated



**self***

The word 'self' is used to represent the instance of a class. By using the "self" keyword we access
the attributes and methods of the class in python.It binds the attributes with the given arguments.
